Maybe and Result 

I have provided for you the interfaces and specs for the maybe and result. I would suggest starting with the Maybe. The 
specs are in a `__tests__` directory within the context of the subjects directory. Each test is marked with a `todo` 
(e.g. `test.todo` or `it.todo`).

Go through each one at a time, removing the todo as you go. Remember to do the simplest implementation to pass the test.
THere is no need to change the either of the interfaces.

The testing framework is [vitest](https://vitest.dev/). There are enough tests to get the desired behaviour, feel free 
to add more if you like but do not remove or change any existing tests (besides removing a `todo` one at a time).

I created this project with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html). 
There are plugins for RubyMine and also for VSCode to help with testing and the like.
