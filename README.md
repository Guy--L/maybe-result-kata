Maybe and Result 

I have provided for you the interfaces and specs for the maybe and result. I would suggest starting with the Maybe. The 
specs are in a `__tests__` directory within the context of the subjects directory. Each test is marked with a `skip` 
(e.g. `test.skip` or `it.skip`).

Go through each one at a time, removing each `skip` as you go. Remember to do the simplest implementation to pass the test.
THere is no need to change the either of the interfaces.

The testing framework is [jest](https://jestjs.io/). There are enough tests to get the desired behaviour, feel free 
to add more if you like but do not remove or change any existing tests (besides removing each `skip` one at a time).

I created this project with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html). 
There are plugins for RubyMine and also for VSCode to help with testing and the like.
